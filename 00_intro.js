// --------------- Pattern / Design Pattern ----------------------
// Resource - https://garywoodfine.com/javascript-module-pattern/

// What is Pattern ?
// - A re-usable solution that can be applied to occuring problems in software design (JavaScript Application)
// - Can also be thought of as programming templates
// - Situations vary significantly

// Main Types of Pattern or design pattern -
// 1. Module pattern
// 2. Revealing Module pattern
// 3. Singleton pattern
// 4. Factory pattern
// 5. Observer pattern
// 6. Mediator pattern
// 7. State pattern


// ---- JS Patterns and modules are not same -- Because design patterns can be a module or a small piece of code which are re-usable solution in software engineering. But modules are simple exported or an imported .js file.


/*
Before ES2015 release, there were at least 3 major modules competing standards:
1. Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
2. RequireJS Modules
3. CommonJS Modules

A single, native module standard was therefore proposed in ES6 (ES2015).
*/

// After ES6, it became quite simpler. Here we use - 'export' and 'export default' for named export and default export respectively, and 'import' to import a module in a js-file.


// What are modules - In JavaScript, the word “modules” refers to small units of independent, reusable code.
// How to incorporate modules in our program - By using 'export' and 'import'.
